Took almost four times as long on average.

6.
Roughly the same average times.

7.
Ping goes up a lot when going to other countries. Although the ping to Europe and Asia/Australia is lover than South America and Africa.

8.
There is likely more mature infrastructure between the US and Europe and Asia/Australia than other countries.

7 hops. 5.9 ms Which corresponds with the overall ping for the website. This makes sense.

Seems to be getting blocked and can't see the countries it goes through.

You'd be much better of using FedEx because that amount of data would take almost 1000 hours to transfer on a 100Mbps link.

16.
3.5 Mbps
4 MB = 32 Mb / 3.5 Mbps = Slightly over 9 seconds.
1.6 Mbps
32 Mb / 1.6 Mbps = 20 seconds
